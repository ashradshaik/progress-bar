				<p>UF’s MBA online is designed to offer maximum flexibility with minimal interruption to students’ professional lives. The program’s primarily asynchronous format allows online learners to view lectures at any time and complete most other assignments, including readings and group projects, as their schedules permit. Students typically spend about 15 hours each week on coursework. The degree itself takes about 24 months complete and requires no campus visits. The online curriculum follows the same schedule as the UF campus calendar, but courses use a convenient five-week block format that allows students to earn credits quickly and lighten their course load as needed.
